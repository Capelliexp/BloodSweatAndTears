# Kung Fu Calamity
Kung Fu Calamity was created during a 3-day period at a game jam using Unreal Engine. The game is a 1v1 2.5D fighter game where players battle to the top of the map, before lethal water engulfs the arena.
The game is created by 4 people, 3 of which had never previously used Unreal Engine. 

Our primary focus was the gameplay, which proved to be very popular, netting us second place.
Short trailer of the result (please excuse the lack of polish):

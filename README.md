# Kung Fu Calamity
Kung Fu Calamity was created during a 3-day period at a game jam using Unreal Engine. The game is a 1v1 2.5D fighter game where players battle to the top of the map, before lethal water engulfs the arena.
The game is created by 4 people, of which 3 had never used Unreal Engine before. 


Short trailer of the results (the video was created during the game jam, please excuse the lack of polish and effort):
